### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love coding. I'm great at it. Haha, what a good joke. Anyways, here's a little more.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Discord bot, [Hurricano.](https://github.com/HurricanoBot/Hurricano)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about APIs, and trying to make one myself.
- ðŸ’¬ I know Node.js.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I know about a website called GitHub.
